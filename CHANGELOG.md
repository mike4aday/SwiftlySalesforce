# Change Log

## Version 7.0.0 (July 12, 2018)
- Deferred login (set `options` in function argument to `[.dontAuthenticate]`)

## Version 6.0.5 (Apr. 12, 2018)
Fixed error in identity method's response handler. (Resolves [issue #60](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/60).)

## Version 6.0.4 (Mar. 1, 2018)
Change access to `ConnectedApp.revoke` method from `internal` to `public`.

## Version 6.0.3 (Jan. 23, 2018)

## Version 6.0.1 (Dec. 7, 2017)
Fixed bug in `Salesorce.apex` and `Salesforce.custom` methods so that callers can now set the HTTP body data.

## Version 6.0.0 (Nov. 5, 2017)
This release contains breaking changes. See [README](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/blob/master/README.md) and [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/SwiftlySalesforce).
Highlights of changes and improvements:
- Incorporated Swift 4's new `Codable` protocol (i.e. `Decodable` and `Encodable` throughout. This simplifies both Swiftly Salesforce's code and the creation of your own models that represent Salesforce objects.
- Simpler and faster to incorporate Swiftly Salesforce in your apps.
- New `Record` type to represent generic Salesforce object records, replaces `SObject` from version 5.0.0. If you prefer, you could create your own model objects and use those instead, via the magic of Swift generics and the new `Codable` protocol. See the [README](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/blob/master/README.md) and example app for samples.
- New `Organization` type holds information about the Salesforce "org." Call `salesforce.org( )` to retrieve org information.
- References to `redirectURL` replaced with `callbackURL` to be consistent with Salesforce [Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=connected_app_overview.htm&type=0) terminology.
- More and better test coverage.

## Version 5.0.0 (Oct. 15, 2017)
This release contains breaking changes. See [README](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/blob/master/README.md) and [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/SwiftlySalesforce).
Highlights of changes and improvements:
- Incorporated Swift 4's new `Decodable` protocol throughout. This simplifies both Swiftly Salesforce's code and the creation of your own models that represent Salesforce objects.
- New `SObject` type to represent a generic Salesforce objects. If you prefer, you can create your own model objects and use those instead, via the magic of Swift generics and the new `Decodable` protocol. See the [README](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/blob/master/README.md) and example app for samples.
- Revamped Error types.
- More and better test coverage.

## Version 4.0.0 (July 14, 2017)
This release contains breaking changes. See [README](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/blob/master/README.md) and [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/SwiftlySalesforce).
Highlights of changes and improvements:
- Removed the `salesforce` singleton (you could still instantiate your own global `salesforce` variable, if you like; see [example](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/blob/master/Example/SwiftlySalesforce/AppDelegate.swift)).
- `Salesforce` now instantiated with new `ConnectedApp` class. See [README](./README.md#example-configure-your-app-delegate).
- Supports switching among multiple users and securely storing their access & refresh tokens.
- `Salesforce.apexREST` method renamed `Salesforce.apex`, and now returns `Promise<Data>` (instead of `Promise<Any>`). 
- New `Salesforce.fetchImage` methods to get relatively-small images, such as user thumbnails or Contact photos ([issue #33](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/33) and [issue #35](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/35)).
- New `Address` struct to hold standard, compound address fields, including longitude and latitude ([issue #38](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/38) and [issue #39](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/39)).

## Version 3.6.0 (Jun. 17, 2017)
Updated the default Salesforce API version to 40.0 (Summer '17)

## Version 3.5.1 (Jun. 7, 2017)
Fixes [issue #29](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/29).

## Version 3.5.0 (Apr. 26, 2017)
- Updated the default Salesforce API version to 39.0 (Spring '17).
- Added method `Salesforce.describeAll()` to retrieve metadata about all objects defined in the org ([issue #28](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/28)).
- Bug fix; `ObjectDescription.keyPrefix` now returns an empty string if the retrieved object metadata value is null. (In the next major release `keyPrefix` will become an optional string.) ([issue #36](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/36))
- `ObjectDescription.fields` now returns an empty dictionary if the retrieved metadata has no field-level information, as is the case with `Salesforce.describeAll()`. (In the next major release, `fields` will become an optional dictionary.)
- Bug fix; `Salesforce.limits()` broke with the Salesforce Spring '17 release, which changed the JSON payload returned by the REST API's `limits` resource ([issue #37](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/37)).
- `Model.UserInfo` and `Model.QueryResult` now have public initializers ([issue #34](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/34)).

## Version 3.4.0 (Feb. 26, 2017)

(Thanks to [@quintonwall](https://github.com/quintonwall) for [pull request](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/pull/24).)

## Version 3.3.2 (Feb. 7, 2017)

- Added overloaded `Salesforce.describe` method to retrieve metadata about multiple Salesforce objects in parallel
- Additional documentation, tests and test coverage

## Version 3.2.0 (Dec. 14, 2016)
- Added Salesforce.describe( ) method, and corresponding [model](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/blob/master/Pod/Classes/Model.swift) structs (ObjectDescription, FieldDescription, PicklistValue) for retrieving [object metadata](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_sobject_describe.htm). (Closes [issue #13](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/13).)

Fixed issue #15; removed unneeded `id` parameter in `Salesforce.insert( )` method

## Version 3.1.0 (Nov. 16, 2016)
- Updated `LoginDelegate` to accommodate custom login view controllers and flows. Note: the default [OAuth2 user-agent flow](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_understanding_user_agent_oauth_flow.htm) with the Salesforce-hosted webform is the recommended way to authenticate users; your app shouldn't handle their credentials. Adapted from [@hmuronaka's pull request](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/pull/14).
- Deprecated `LoginDelegate` extension method `handleRedirectURL(redirectURL: URL)` in favor of `handleRedirectURL(url: URL)`.

## Version 3.0.1 (Oct. 27, 2016)
Added file "OAuth2.plist" which is used for testing the framework. If you run the tests, edit the file and insert your own values for the Salesforce access token, refresh token, etc.
